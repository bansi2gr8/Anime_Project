          <h4>Testimonial</h4>
          <p>
            Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced
            by it. It is the Japanese term for cartoon or animation where the
            Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the
            nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that
            come exclusively from Japan, distinguished by blazing graphics,
            energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance,
            and supernatural forces. Therefore, consider this syllogism: all
            anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime.The art
            style connected with anime is distinct and easily identifiable.
            Large eyes, untamed hair, lengthy arms and limbs, and other features
            are certainly known to you. This exaggerated design allows the
            characters to convey their emotions more freely, which is plentiful
            in anime.Technical animation methods like dramatic closeups and
            zooms, vivid lighting, and brilliant colors contribute to the
            anime’s emotional atmosphere. However, beyond its unusual visual
            appearance, anime has endeared itself to viewers; thanks to its
            nuanced characters and compelling plotlines.Anime has been around
            for almost a century. The first confirmed example, Namakura Gatana,
            was released in 1917 and lasted only four minutes. It faced highs
            and lows as it overcame various hurdles domestically and
            globally.Various artists have pushed the boundaries and stories told
            with anime as their preferred choice of medium. The genres that fall
            under this umbrella are as varied as the art form. Many people in
            the West have a perception of how anime looks.Artistry and styles
            appear endless, and artistic expression depends on the artists.
            However, regardless of the different types, one thing is consistent
            throughout these productions: the process is
            time-consuming.Technically, anime is identical to the animation
            produced in Western culture.

            The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A
            characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of
            cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing
            a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically,
            through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the
            Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations
            of Japanese comics manga, light novels, or video games. It is
            classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche
            audiences.Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production
            methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It
            combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other
            forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.Compared to
            Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
            movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera
            effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.Diverse art
            styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite
            varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive
            eyes.In the 1950s, anime studios began appearing across Japan.
            Hiroshi Takahata bought a studio named Japan Animated Films in 1948,
            renaming it Tōei Dōga, with an ambition to become "the Disney of the
            East." While there, Takahata met other animators such as Yasuji
            Mori, who directed Doodling Kitty, in May 1957.

            Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto. Itachi
            is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha, and is responsible for
            killing all the elder members of their clan, sparing only Sasuke. He
            appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and
            serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy.During the second part of the
            manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas possessing
            tailed-beast creatures (Jinchuriki) until facing Sasuke in a
            one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final duel,
            it is later revealed that Itachi had a secret reason for
            assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character in
            most of the video games from the series. Itachi's character has been
            popular with readers of the manga and has been positively received
            by critics. He is considered by many to be one of the best
            characters in the series. His appearance as an antagonist has been
            praised by several writers, although some have considered his
            initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of
            his past and its impact on the story has also received positive
            reception,and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in the
            series.Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's
            likeness, including keychains, plush dolls and figurines.When Itachi
            Uchiha is first mentioned by Sasuke Uchiha in the manga, Masashi
            Kishimoto had not planned out the character's backstory. His only
            idea he had was to attribute to Itachi some violent action that
            would have Sasuke wanting to kill him. However, when Itachi was
            introduced, Kishimoto had the idea to make Itachi Konoha's secret
            agent who killed his clan under their orders.Itachi was originally
            conceived as the leader of Konoha's Special Assassination.
